cerebral atrophy, n:
        The phenomena which occurs as become weak and sick, and
impair the performance.  An abundance of these "bad" can cause
symptoms related to senility, apathy, depression, and overall poor academic
performance.  A certain small number of will deteriorate due to
everday activity, but large amounts are weakened by intense mental effort
and the assimilation of difficult concepts.  Many college students become
victims of this dread disorder due to poor habits such as overstudying.

cerebral darwinism, n:
        The theory that the effects of cerebral atrophy can be reversed
through the purging action of heavy alcohol consumption.  Large amounts of
alcohol cause many to perish due to oxygen deprivation.  Through
the process of natural selection, the weak and sick will die
first, leaving only the healthy.  This wonderful process leaves the
imbiber with a healthier, more vibrant and increases mental capacity.
Thus, the devastating effects of cerebral atrophy are reversed, and academic
performance actually increases beyond previous levels.
